This is like the behaviour of the `rdsamp` function of the original WFDB c package. Note that `wfdb.plot_record` only works if the record object has the `p_signals` field.\n",
    "2. expanded - A list of 1d numpy arrays is returned as the e_d_signal or e_p_signal field. All samples for each channel are returned in its respective numpy array. The arrays may have different lengths depending on their `samps_per_frame` values.\n",
